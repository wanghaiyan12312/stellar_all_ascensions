# More Ascsension Path and Dark Engine Trait for Cyber Species.
**abstract:** this mod is design for stellar to allow cyber and psionic and biological ascsension compatible with each other. and have some other feature to improve the playability by all I want in a game that can't be determined by what paradox told me to do. 

1. only one ascension path I can take? 

2. the syth queen titan I can't build 

3. did I must suck with so much repeatable technology in my reasearch pool?

4. battlecruise don't have point setting? 

5. I can't get crisis weapon technology before the crisis come when i have 1m research point a month? 

6. the fallen empire is too weak

7. one mega shipyard don't satisfied 100k+ alloy production capacity?


## More Ascensions Path
First thanks for Draconas, his All Ascension Paths give me a lot of inspiration to this mod. my code is basically refactoring his project. [All Ascension Path](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2909582424)

Second thanks for Azona, his 28 Ascension Perk Slots and 11 Traditions Slots mod need modification parameter to adapt my mod. [28 Ascension Perk Slots and 11 Traditions Slots](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2271408535&searchtext=slot)

### 1. You can have 17 traditons to take and 18 ap slot.
this is design 20 level planet ascension to take one planet empire sprawl to zero.
 - 17 traditon you can choose.  
![alt text](/Readme_Picture/English/image.png)

 - 20 level planet ascension.
![alt text](/Readme_Picture/English/image-1.png) 
    > Note:  if you take like harmony tradition you get a negative digit of planet empire size. i think that is better.

### 2. you can chooss psionic and cyber, biological ascsension path both.
![alt text](/Readme_Picture/English/image-2.png)

I exclude synth age ascsension for I replace it with a mod ascension modularity age.

If you finish the biological ascension situation you can launche a edict to take other two biological ascsension. the three biological ascsension is ***not flexbile*** so it don't affected by you ***situation choose***.

![alt text](/Readme_Picture/English/image-28.png)
   > Note: ***hive mind*** can't get mutiple ascsension,beacuse the offical don't support hive psionic. some special origin also dont support.
   > - ***Evolutional Predators***
   > - ***Cybernetic Creed***
   > - ***Sythetic Fertility***
   > - ***Progenitor Hive***
   > - ***Clone Army***
   > - ***Resource Consolidation***
   > - ***Hard Reset*** 
   > - ***Tree of Life***  
   > - ***Teachers of the Shroud***  
### 3. advanced robort trait for cyber pop.
In this Mod I create a Robot Modularity to allow player to add advanced robort trait in cyber species.

![alt text](/Readme_Picture/English/image-4.png)
the Robot Modularity tradition has following effect:
- Adpot tradition: metallurgists living metal produces add 0.1.
- High-Speed Replacements: pop workforce add 10%,monthly auto mod add 400.
- Liquid Metal Joints: roboticist assembly add 1,living metal upkeep add 1.
- Maintenance Protocols: robotic amenities usage reduce 10%.
- High-Level Enhancements: robotic upkeep reduce 25%. roboticist upkeep reduce 25%.
- Advanced Tools: ROBOT species trait points add 6,ROBOT species trait picks add = 4,modify species cost reduce 50%.

   > Note: After take ***Advanced Tools*** tradition. you can get all adcanced robort trait for robort and cyber pop it look like following.
   > 
   > ![alt text](/Readme_Picture/English/image-3.png)

### 4. specail assimilation living standards convenience for global default species setting.
if you take psionic and cyber ascension, you have to assimilation one species two times. this mod create a new living standards to assimilation one species one times, and hide Transubstantiation Synthesis and Transcendent Awakening assimilation standard.
   > Note: if you take Transubstantiation Synthesis and then take the mod assimilation it will appear two same species template. it can't fix without map data structure (mod not support).

### 5.Advanced government switch
After take more than one ascensions path, you can reform you government to advanced authority. if you want change your advanced type you can launch a edict.
![alt text](/Readme_Picture/English/image-6.png)

![alt text](/Readme_Picture/English/image-7.png)

   > Note: during the game when you get option to choose reform advanced authority. it is better to not reform two ***advanced authority*** like I choose purity advanced authority and than mutation advanced authority. that would make you have both benefit of two advanced authority. it can be correct by this edict.
### 6.Ascsension Leader Trait Repair
It is wierd when you take Erudite species Modification, it will take the leader psionic trait disappered. I will show that in following picture.
Before take Erudite species Modification
![alt text](/Readme_Picture/English/image-9.png)
After take Erudite species Modification
![alt text](/Readme_Picture/English/image-8.png)

this is the game engine code effect that can't change by mod code, so I take two way to repair it.

- you can re-assign you leader get you leader trait back like this.

![alt text](/Readme_Picture/English/image-10.png)

re-assign possition

![alt text](/Readme_Picture/English/image-11.png)

## Syth Queen Titan 

if you take cosmogenesis ascension perk, you will get Syth Queen Titan ship design if you have colossus project and juggernaut technology in crisis level 5.

![alt text](/Readme_Picture/English/image-14.png)

If you have fulled condition you will have Syth Queen Titan technology option.

![alt text](/Readme_Picture/English/image-13.png)

and then you can design a Syth Queen Titan you like I change the default shield point equal to armor point that make more reasonable all is 1500000. 20 large utility slots 10 aux utility slots instead of 10 large utility slots 20 aux utility slots.

   > Note: the reactor may too many,but i don't want fix it that will expand the lines of code that I think no meaning.

![alt text](/Readme_Picture/English/image-18.png)

the Syth Queen Titan must build in mega shipyard 3

![alt text](/Readme_Picture/English/image-19.png)

the Syth Queen Titan can be assign a commander and be incorprated into a formation. you can build 4 Syth Queen Titan. 

![alt text](/Readme_Picture/English/image-22.png)

   > Note: you can have Syth Queen knowledge tech option if you acheive crisis 5 that give you 20% research speed in early game, and ***the ruler of reality*** can only be researched by ***twice***. ***Syth Queen repair system*** you can research after you take Syth Queen Knownlege.

## Battlecruise and Paradox Titan Point Defence Template

In offical edition you not have Point Defence for Battlecruise and Paradox Titan. But aircraft is too affected perfomace when you have lot. So I add 3 Point Defence Template. 

![alt text](/Readme_Picture/English/image-23.png)

![alt text](/Readme_Picture/English/image-24.png)

For Against Crisis bonus Fallen Empire I Change Titan Limit from 20 to 500.

![alt text](/Readme_Picture/English/image-25.png)

And when you summon the Dimensional Fleet you can get Extradimensional Weapon technology that I think reasonable.

![alt text](/Readme_Picture/English/image-26.png)

When you finish pisonic tradition you get Psionic Barrier

![alt text](/Readme_Picture/English/image-27.png)

   > Note: the other crisis weapon you can get by finish low weapon technology. For example you will get skrand strike craft technology after you finish advanced strike craft technology.

## Auto technology
First thanks for hollytan Auther, his '自动科研助手' give me a lot of inspiration to this mod. this part of code is basically refactoring his project. [自动科研助手](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3253950177)

After you finish all non-repeatable technology. you must be trouble by the repeatable technology hand choose, i just want energy weapon damage, not energy output.
So this mod add a edict to choose which endless repeatable technology you want research.
![alt text](/Readme_Picture/English/image-15.png)

This edict give you three category you can effect auto reasearch.

![alt text](/Readme_Picture/English/image-16.png)

In this example I choose the shield out in physical category. 

![alt text](/Readme_Picture/English/image-17.png)

It effect like this, only one technology in your pool. so you can auto research it.

![alt text](/Readme_Picture/English/image-20.png)
