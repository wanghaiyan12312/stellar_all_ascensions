[h1]All Ascension Paths for 4.0[/h1]

[h1]Do you want your psionic, cybernetic, gene modded pops working hand in hand with synths?[/h1]

[h1]Do you your genes to be pure, cloned and also highly mutated?[/h1]

[h1]Do you want to give worthy species psionics, while turning the dross into synths?[/h1]

[h1]Do you want your Machine Empire to have modular, nanite-based bodies, accessible virtually?[/h1]

I'm guessing so because you're looking at this mod.

Regular empires can take all 4 Ascensions, when you Synthetically Ascend you get to pick a portion of your population to remain as organic, because if you've taken the others, they are a bit good by this point.

Hive minds can take both genetics and cybernetics, Driven Assimilators can take synthetic age, cybernetics and engineered evolution.

While you can take the ascension paths in any order, but because of how internal game logic works around dominant species I recommend [b](psionics and genetics)* -> cybernetics -> synthetics[/b].  *(Psionics and genetics can be in either order)

Use the Assimilation Living standard to determine if an assimilated pop gets cyborg/psionics traits or goes to synths.  See [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2909582424/3845556684666810578/]Assimilation Manual[/url]

Because there are [i]lots[/i] of edge cases around this, you are provided with 3 edicts that will fix your primary species to have psionics and cybernetics if they have lost them, and ensure that biological leaders will get psionics, cybernetics and erudite.

If you have the Machine Age DLC then whether you get cybernetic or synthetic advanced government will depend on whether you flip your leaders to synths or keep them biological.

If you are a Machine Empire you will get an [b]edict[/b] to gain access to the additional tradition trees after you take the first.

If you have Biogenesis DLC you will get an [b]edict[/b] to gain access to the additional tradition trees after you take the first.  If you have an origin that would normally lock to one Biogenesis tradition, I strongly recommend taking that one first.

[b]Compatibility[/b]
This mod makes a lot of changes to vanilla, it will have mod conflicts with any other mod that alters those giving quite unpredictable behaviour.  See [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2909582424/5371139102176333048]Here[/url] for compatibility listings.

I have origin-unlocked all the ascension paths, [b]but I make no guarentees that they will work in a sane way[/b] - if you do something massively against the spirit of one of the paths, it will probably break.

This does not require the Machine Age / Biogenesis DLCs, DLC locked components will remain locked, however I will no longer support/maintain the non-DLC ascension paths.

[b]Known Compatibility Issues[/b]
[list]
[*] [b]Planetary Diversity[/b]: Changes the Traditions and AP's around it's special origins.  In theory load mine last / patch with Irony and take mine and you should be fine
[*] Pretty much any mod that has [b]"Traditions"[/b] in its name, since most of them make changes to the Ascension Traditions.
[/list]
It is compatible with UI Overhaul Dynamic and its sub-mods that increase the number of traditions you can buy.

[b]Troubleshooting[/b]
1. Mod incompatibility, if another mod overrides the same stuff, we will almost certainly conflict badly. You will need to make a merge-patch with Irony.
2. In order to troubleshoot I need to know what order you did your ascensions in.  They all work differently and order really matters.
3. Taking multiple ascensions gives you a 100% discount on modify species. It also sometimes bugs out the modify species special project, if you can't click the button to implement it, let it fail then try again.
4. If assimilation is not working as expected, I need to know a lot of things, you may wish to take screenshots:  What the species is, what it's citizenship type is, what its living standard is, what your assimilation policy is, what other templates exist for that species, what the error log says and what the game log says.
